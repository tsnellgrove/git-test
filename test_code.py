# purpose: practice git-based replication between iPad WorkingCopy / Pythonista and Mac VS Code

# Git repo is now cloned in VS Code - next is pull test

# apparently the VS code updates didn't come through - got to github - but then got reversed by iPad Working Copy
# idea key steps on VS Code commit: 1. Save, 2. Stage, 3. Commit Message, 4. Commit, 5. Push

# Attempt 2 to update from Mac / VS Code
